# Chapter 2 - Expressions, Varibles and Constants

> Challenge 1 - Variables : Declare a constant int called myAge and set it
equal to your age. Also declare an int variable
called dogs and set that equal to the number of
dogs you own. Then imagine you bought a new
puppy and increment the dogs variable by one.

> Challenge 2 - Make it compile : 
> Given the following code:
age = 16;
print(age);
age = 30;
print(age);
Modify the ﬁrst line so that the code compiles.
Did you use var , int , ﬁnal or const ?

```Dart
int,var
```

> Challenge 3 : Compute the answer
> Consider the following code:const x = 46;
const y = 10;
Work out what each answer equals when you add
the following lines of code to the code above:
const answer1 = (x * 100) + y;
const answer2 = (x * 100) + (y * 100);
const answer3 = (x * 100) + (y / 10);

> Challenge 4 : Average Rating
> Declare three constants called rating1 , rating2
and rating3 of type double and assign each a
value. Calculate the average of the three and
store the result in a constant named
averageRating .

> Challenge 5 : Quadratic Equation
> A quadratic equation is something of the form
a⋅x² + b⋅x + c = 0 .
The values of x which satisfy this can be solved
by using the equationx = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a) .
Declare three constants named a , b and c of type
double . Then calculate the two values for x using
the equation above (noting that the ± means plus
or minus, so one value of x for each). Store the
results in constants called root1 and root2 of
type double.

# Chapter 3 : Types & Operations

> Challenge 1 : Teacher's Grading
> You’re a teacher, and in your class, attendance is
worth 20% of the grade, the homework is worth
30% and the exam is worth 50%. Your student
got 90 points for her attendance, 80 points for
her homework and 94 points on her exam.
Calculate her grade as an integer percentage
rounded down.

> Challenge 4 : Find the Error
> What is wrong with the following code?
```Dart
const name = 'Ray';
name += ' Wenderlich';
```

> once value is assign in const we can't change the value.

> Challenge 5 : What type?
> What's the type of value?
```Dart
const value = 10 / 2;
```
